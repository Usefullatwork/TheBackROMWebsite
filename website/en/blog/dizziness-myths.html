          <h2>Dizziness - an underestimated problem</h2>
          <p>Dizziness affects between 15 and 20 percent of adults each year (Neuhauser, 2016). Yet few complaints are surrounded by so many misconceptions. In this article, I address the most common myths and give you fact-based information about what actually helps.</p>

          <h2>Myth 1: "Dizziness and vertigo are the same thing"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Dizziness is a broad term that encompasses several different experiences: feeling unstable, lightheaded, about to faint, or that the world is spinning around. Vertigo is a specific subtype where you experience a sensation of rotation.</p>
          <p>Distinguishing between these is important for finding the right cause and treatment. Vertigo often points to the vestibular system, while other types of dizziness can be caused by anything from blood pressure drops to neck problems or anxiety.</p>

          <h2>Myth 2: "Dizziness is always caused by BPPV"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> BPPV is indeed the most common vestibular cause of vertigo - it accounts for about 50 percent of all vestibular diagnoses. But dizziness has many other potential causes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vestibular migraine</strong> (1-3% of population) - the second most common cause of recurring dizziness episodes</li>
            <li><strong>Cervicogenic dizziness</strong> - unsteadiness and disorientation linked to neck problems</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular neuritis</strong> - inflammation of the balance nerve, often after viral infection</li>
            <li><strong>Meniere's disease</strong> - dizziness combined with hearing loss and tinnitus</li>
            <li><strong>Blood pressure drops and medication side effects</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>That's why a thorough examination is so important - treatment varies significantly depending on the cause.</p>

          <h2>Myth 3: "You just have to live with dizziness"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> This is perhaps the most harmful myth. Many live unnecessarily long with symptoms because they believe there is no treatment. The reality is that most cases of dizziness can be treated effectively:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>BPPV:</strong> The Epley maneuver resolves the problem in 80-90% within 1-3 treatments (Cochrane 2014)</li>
            <li><strong>Cervicogenic dizziness:</strong> Manual treatment of the neck shows moderate evidence for improvement</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular rehabilitation:</strong> Exercises that train the balance system have documented effect</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular migraine:</strong> Treated with a combination of lifestyle changes and possibly preventive medications</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Myth 4: "Medication is the only solution"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Medications like meclizine can reduce symptoms in the short term, but they rarely treat the underlying cause. For BPPV, research concludes that repositioning maneuvers should be first-line treatment, as they have "superiority over medications that have uncertain effect" (Academic Emergency Medicine, 2022).</p>
          <p>Long-term use of centrally acting suppressants can actually delay healing by inhibiting the brain's natural compensation mechanisms. Guidelines recommend that such medications not be used for more than 2-3 consecutive days.</p>

          <h2>Myth 5: "Dizziness only affects the elderly"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> While risk increases with age, dizziness can occur at any age. Vestibular migraine, for example, is most common in working-age women. Studies show that 6-8% of children experience episodes of vertigo.</p>
          <p>Dismissing dizziness as "normal aging" can lead to treatable conditions remaining undetected.</p>

          <h2>Myth 6: "Lying still is the best treatment"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Many actually find that symptoms worsen when lying down and closing their eyes. After the acute phase, it's important to resume activity because this helps the brain compensate for the imbalance in signals from the balance system.</p>
          <p>Vestibular rehabilitation - controlled exercises that challenge the balance system - is actually an important part of treatment for many types of dizziness.</p>

          <h2>Myth 7: "It's all in your head"</h2>
          <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Dizziness is a real medical condition with concrete physical causes. That many also develop anxiety in connection with dizziness is understandable - the fear that symptoms will recur can be very burdensome.</p>
          <p>But anxiety resulting from dizziness is not the same as dizziness being "all in your head." A thorough examination will reveal whether there are underlying vestibular or musculoskeletal causes.</p>

            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              <li><strong>Sudden, severe headache</strong> - different from what you've experienced before</li>
              <li><strong>Speech difficulties</strong> or problems understanding speech</li>
              <li><strong>Visual disturbances</strong> (double vision, visual field loss)</li>
              <li><strong>One-sided weakness</strong> or numbness in face, arm, or leg</li>

          <h2>What can a chiropractor do for dizziness?</h2>
          <p>Chiropractors with special expertise in dizziness can offer:</p>

          <h3>Diagnostics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dix-Hallpike test to detect BPPV</li>
            <li>VNG (videonystagmography) for objective measurement of eye movements</li>
            <li>TRV chair for precise diagnosis and treatment of BPPV</li>
            <li>Thorough neck examination when cervicogenic dizziness is suspected</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Treatment</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Epley maneuver and other repositioning maneuvers for BPPV</li>
            <li>Manual treatment of neck for cervicogenic dizziness</li>
            <li>Vestibular rehabilitation - individual exercise programs</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For BPPV, you can expect 1-3 treatments. For cervicogenic dizziness, the treatment course varies depending on how long-standing and complex the problem is.</p>

          <h2>Prognosis and recurrence risk</h2>
          <p>Most types of dizziness have good prognosis with correct treatment. For BPPV, repositioning maneuvers give immediate improvement in most cases.</p>
          <p>However, it's important to be realistic about recurrence risk. Research shows that BPPV recurrence occurs in 10-25% after successful treatment, with up to 22% experiencing recurrence within 5 years. About 70% of recurrences happen within the first year.</p>
          <p><strong>Risk factors for recurrence include:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>High blood pressure and high cholesterol</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency</li>
            <li>Migraine</li>
            <li>Previous head injury</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The good news is that treatment is equally effective for recurrences, and you can get help again.</p>
