          <h2>What does it mean to be dizzy and nauseous?</h2>
          <p>The combination can feel dramatic - many describe it as literally losing their footing. There are many possible explanations, from completely harmless conditions that can be treated in one consultation, to more serious causes that require prompt medical attention.</p>
          <p>This article helps you understand what might be behind your symptoms, and when you should seek what type of healthcare.</p>

          <h2>Causes of dizziness and nausea</h2>

          <h3>Vestibular causes (balance organ)</h3>

          <h4>BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) - most common</h4>
          <p>Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), often called "crystal disease," is the most common cause of dizziness when you seek specialist help. The condition accounts for 17-42% of cases in dizziness clinics. Lifetime prevalence is 2.4%.</p>
          <p>Small calcium crystals in the inner ear become dislodged and end up in the semicircular canals, where they disturb balance signals. The result is intense, brief dizziness attacks (under one minute) triggered by head movements - typically when lying down, turning over in bed, or looking up. Nausea is common during attacks.</p>
          <p>Women are affected 2.2 times more often than men, and the condition is most common between ages 50-70.</p>

          <h4>Vestibular migraine - underdiagnosed</h4>
          <p>Vestibular migraine affects 1-2.7% of the population and is the second most common cause of recurring dizziness attacks. Yet only 10% of those who meet diagnostic criteria are told that migraine is the cause of their dizziness.</p>
          <p>Attacks last from 5 minutes to 72 hours and often include headache, light or sound sensitivity. An important diagnostic criterion is precisely that head movement-triggered dizziness WITH nausea is a characteristic symptom.</p>

          <h4>Vestibular neuritis</h4>
          <p>Vestibular neuritis is an inflammation of the balance nerve, often following a viral infection. Annual incidence is 3.5-15.5 per 100,000, equivalent to about 500-1000 cases in Norway per year.</p>
          <p>Symptoms come suddenly: severe rotational dizziness, pronounced nausea and vomiting, and difficulty walking. Unlike BPPV, symptoms are constant (not episodic). Most experience significant improvement within 1-3 days, and 50% are symptom-free within 6 weeks.</p>

          <h4>Meniere's disease - rare</h4>
          <p>Meniere's disease is relatively rare with a prevalence of about 43 per 100,000. The condition causes attacks with dizziness (20 minutes to 12 hours), hearing loss, tinnitus, and pressure sensation in the ear.</p>

          <h3>Non-vestibular causes</h3>

          <h4>Orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure drop)</h4>
          <p>When blood pressure drops sharply with position changes, you can become dizzy and nauseous. This affects about 20% of adults over 60 and up to 50% of nursing home patients.</p>

          <h4>Anxiety and functional dizziness</h4>
          <p>28.3% of patients with dizziness have symptoms of at least one anxiety disorder. Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a chronic condition that often starts after an acute dizziness episode, affecting 15-20% of patients in specialist clinics.</p>

          <h4>Low blood sugar</h4>
          <p>Hypoglycemia often gives dizziness as the first symptom - 72.3% report this. Nausea, trembling, and hunger typically follow.</p>

          <h4>Medication side effects</h4>
          <p>Over 1000 medications have dizziness as a known side effect. Blood pressure medication, sedatives, painkillers, and epilepsy medications are common culprits. In elderly patients, medications explain 23% of persistent dizziness.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #dc2626; margin-top: 0;">Red Flags - Call Emergency Services for Acute Dizziness With:</h3>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              <li><strong>Paralysis</strong> or numbness in face/arm/leg</li>
              <li><strong>Speech difficulties</strong> or comprehension problems</li>
              <li><strong>Double vision</strong> or vision loss</li>
              <li><strong>Chest pain</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Severe headache</strong> - especially if new onset</li>
              <li><strong>Cannot stand or walk</strong></li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Treatment</h2>

          <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>

          <h4>BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo)</h4>
          <p>The Epley maneuver is the gold standard. A meta-analysis shows that 74% become symptom-free - 6.5 times better than control groups. A systematic review from 2022 shows NNT of 3, meaning that every third patient treated becomes symptom-free compared to no treatment.</p>
          <p>The modified Epley technique gives 85% success on first treatment versus 63% for traditional technique. For comparison: Untreated BPPV gives only 18% improvement after one month.</p>
          <p>Recurrence is common - about 30% experience symptoms again within one year, and 50% within five years. This means most will need treatment again at some point.</p>

          <h4>Neck-related dizziness</h4>
          <p>Cervicogenic dizziness is a debated diagnosis. The Barany Society has explicitly refused to propose diagnostic criteria because evidence for a direct mechanistic connection between neck and dizziness is lacking.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, there are patients who experience improvement of dizziness after neck treatment. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized studies (898 patients) found moderate quality evidence that manual therapy reduces dizziness, neck symptoms, and balance problems.</p>

          <h3>What can you expect?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>BPPV:</strong> Many experience significant improvement after 1-3 treatments</li>
            <li><strong>Neck-related:</strong> Typically 4-8 treatments over several weeks</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular rehabilitation:</strong> 4-12 week program for more complex conditions</li>
          </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>How long does nausea last with dizziness?</h4>
              <p>It depends on the cause. With BPPV, nausea typically lasts seconds to minutes after head movement. With vestibular neuritis, nausea can persist for days. With migraine, it can last for hours.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Can stress cause dizziness and nausea?</h4>
              <p>Yes. Stress and anxiety can cause hyperventilation which causes dizziness. Additionally, 30-50% of dizziness patients are also affected by anxiety or depression - this is a biological connection, not "imagined."</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Is dizziness and nausea dangerous?</h4>
              <p>Usually not. Most causes are benign and treatable. But acute dizziness with neurological symptoms (paralysis, speech difficulties, visual disturbances) can be signs of stroke and requires immediate medical evaluation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>What helps against nausea?</h4>
              <p>Treat the cause of dizziness. With BPPV, repositioning maneuver gives rapid improvement. During attacks, it can help to lie still, focus on a fixed point, and take deep breaths. Anti-nausea medications can be used short-term but should not be used for more than 2-3 days as they can delay healing.</p>
