          <h2>What is BPPV (Crystal Disease)?</h2>
          <p>BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo) - also known as crystal disease - is the most common cause of dizziness when lying down or changing head position. The condition is caused by small calcium particles (otoliths) that have dislodged from their normal place in the inner ear and ended up in the semicircular canals.</p>
          <p>These crystals disturb the fluid flow in the semicircular canals when you move your head. This gives the brain conflicting signals about the body's position, resulting in a brief but intense feeling that the room is spinning.</p>
          <p>The condition is benign - it is not caused by serious illness - but can be very bothersome and significantly affect daily life.</p>

          <h2>How Common Is It?</h2>
          <p>BPPV affects around 2.4% of the population during their lifetime. In Norway, this corresponds to approximately 80,000 new cases each year. The condition is most common in people over 50 years old, and women are affected twice as often as men.</p>
          <p>By age 80, up to 10% of the population has experienced at least one episode. A Norwegian registry study showed that dizziness accounts for nearly 1% of all long-term sick leave.</p>

          <h2>Symptoms</h2>
          <p>The classic symptom is brief, intense rotational vertigo triggered by specific head movements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lying down in bed</li>
            <li>Turning over in bed (especially to one side)</li>
            <li>Tilting the head back (e.g., looking up into a cupboard)</li>
            <li>Rising quickly from a lying position</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Typical Course</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Delay:</strong> 5-10 seconds after the head movement before the dizziness starts</li>
            <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically under 60 seconds - rarely over one minute</li>
            <li><strong>Additional symptoms:</strong> Nausea is common, vomiting occurs with severe episodes</li>
            <li><strong>After-effect:</strong> Mild lightheadedness and unsteadiness for minutes to hours afterward</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>This is NOT Typical for BPPV</h3>
          <p>The following symptoms suggest a different cause and require further investigation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hearing loss or tinnitus</li>
            <li>Pressure or fullness in the ear</li>
            <li>Persistent dizziness (not just with head movements)</li>
            <li>Neurological symptoms such as double vision, numbness, or paralysis</li>
          </ul>

          <!-- Warning Box -->
          <div class="warning-box" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #fef2f2 0%, #fee2e2 100%); border-left: 4px solid #dc2626; padding: 20px; margin: 30px 0; border-radius: 8px;">
            <h3 style="color: #dc2626; margin-top: 0;">Red Flags - Seek Medical Attention For:</h3>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              <li><strong>Sudden hearing loss</strong> together with dizziness</li>
              <li><strong>Double vision</strong>, blurred vision, or visual field loss</li>
              <li><strong>Severe headache</strong> - especially if new onset</li>
              <li><strong>Numbness, weakness</strong>, or paralysis in face/arm/leg</li>
              <li><strong>Slurred speech</strong> or difficulty swallowing</li>
              <li><strong>Severe difficulty walking</strong> - unable to stand or walk</li>
              <li><strong>Persistent dizziness</strong> (hours/days) that doesn't stop when still</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>Causes - From Most Common to Rarest</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Idiopathic (unknown cause):</strong> 50-70% of cases - the crystals dislodge without finding any specific reason</li>
            <li><strong>Age-related:</strong> Risk increases significantly after age 50, likely due to natural wear and tear</li>
            <li><strong>Migraine:</strong> Four times higher risk compared to people without migraine</li>
            <li><strong>Head injury:</strong> Accounts for 7-17% of cases</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular neuritis:</strong> About 10% develop BPPV after this viral infection</li>
            <li><strong>Osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency:</strong> Increased risk, likely due to affected calcium metabolism</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Treatment</h2>

          <h3>What Can the Chiropractor Do?</h3>
          <p>Treatment consists of repositioning maneuvers - controlled head movements that help the crystals migrate back to where they belong. The most commonly used is the Epley maneuver for the posterior canal.</p>
          <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> A Cochrane review from 2014 (11 studies, 745 patients) showed that the Epley maneuver gives 4.2 times higher probability of improvement compared to no treatment. Number needed to treat (NNT) is 3 - meaning that for every third patient treated, one becomes completely symptom-free who otherwise would not have.</p>
          <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> 61-80% become symptom-free after one treatment. Over 90% improve after 1-3 treatments.</p>

          <h3>What Can You Do Yourself?</h3>
          <p>For recurrent episodes, you can learn to perform home exercises:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Brandt-Daroff exercises:</strong> 5 repetitions, 3 times daily for 2 weeks. These are less effective than professional repositioning maneuvers (22-23% success vs. 80%+), but can be useful as a supplement.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Epley:</strong> After the diagnosis is confirmed and you have received instruction, you can perform the maneuver yourself for recurrences.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleeping position:</strong> Avoid sleeping on the affected side for the first few days after treatment.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prognosis</h2>

          <h3>With Treatment</h3>
          <p>The outlook is generally very good. Over 90% achieve complete symptom relief with proper treatment. Many notice significant improvement immediately after the repositioning maneuver.</p>

          <h3>Without Treatment</h3>
          <p>BPPV often resolves on its own, but it takes time: only 4% are better after one week, 18% after one month, and 51% after one year. Given how bothersome the condition is, treatment provides significantly faster improvement.</p>

          <h3>Recurrence</h3>
          <p>It's important to be prepared that BPPV can return:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>10-18% have recurrence within one year</li>
            <li>About 22% within five years</li>
            <li>Up to 50% over 10 years</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Higher risk of recurrence is seen in people with migraine, diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation can significantly reduce recurrence risk.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 0;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Is BPPV dangerous?</h4>
              <p>No, the condition is benign and is not caused by serious illness. "Benign" in BPPV means exactly that. However, you should have the diagnosis confirmed and rule out other causes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Can BPPV go away on its own?</h4>
              <p>Yes, but it often takes weeks to months. With treatment, most people improve within 1-2 consultations. Treatment therefore provides significantly faster improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Can stress cause BPPV?</h4>
              <p>Stress is not a direct cause, but high stress levels can enhance symptom perception and are associated with increased recurrence risk. Migraine, which is stress-related, is a known risk factor.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
              <h4>Can I exercise with BPPV?</h4>
              <p>In the acute phase, you should avoid activities with rapid head movements and work at heights/ladders due to fall and accident risk. After successful treatment, you can gradually resume normal activity.</p>
