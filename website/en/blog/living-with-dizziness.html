          <h2>Do You Recognize Yourself?</h2>
          <p>Many live with dizziness without seeking help because they think it's something they just have to accept. But here's the good news: <strong>Dizziness is rarely something you "just have to live with."</strong></p>
          <p>Population studies show that dizziness affects 15-20% of adults in a year. Women are affected 2-3 times more often than men, and incidence increases with age. But that doesn't mean it's "normal" - it means there are many like you who could benefit from an evaluation.</p>

          <h2>Three Myths You Often Hear</h2>

          <h3>"Dizziness is part of aging"</h3>
          <p>Research from Imperial College London has established that dizziness is not a normal part of aging. Yes, incidence increases - studies show that up to 31% of people over 80 experience dizziness, but this is due to treatable conditions, not aging itself. The most common causes in the elderly are BPPV and medication side effects, both with good treatment options.</p>

          <h3>"It's just stress"</h3>
          <p>Stress can actually trigger or worsen dizziness. A study of 7,750 people showed that those with anxiety disorders had more than double the risk of developing BPPV. But that means stress-related dizziness is a real condition that deserves attention - not something you should just "relax" away from.</p>

          <h3>"It will go away on its own"</h3>
          <p>Some forms of dizziness can resolve spontaneously. But many wait unnecessarily long. With proper treatment, many can experience significant improvement in just a few consultations - instead of adapting daily life around the symptoms for months or years.</p>

          <h2>The Most Common Causes of Dizziness</h2>

          <h3>1. BPPV - Vertigo</h3>
          <p>BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) is the most common cause of rotational dizziness and accounts for 17-42% of all dizziness cases. The condition occurs when small calcium particles dislodge in the inner ear and end up in the semicircular canals.</p>
          <p><strong>Typical characteristics:</strong> Brief, intense dizziness episodes (seconds to one minute) triggered by head movements - such as turning in bed, bending down, or looking up.</p>
          <p><strong>Treatment response:</strong> Studies show 80-90% improvement with repositioning maneuvers like Epley. Many experience improvement after one treatment, while others need 2-3 treatments. Success rate after repeated treatments is over 90-95%.</p>

          <h3>2. Cervicogenic Dizziness (Neck-Related)</h3>
          <p>Studies show that up to 40% of patients with neck pain also experience dizziness. The upper cervical vertebrae (C1-C3) contain a high concentration of position sense receptors that send information to the brain about head position. When these signals are disturbed, the result can be unsteadiness and dizziness.</p>
          <p><strong>Typical characteristics:</strong> Persistent unsteadiness that worsens with neck movements, often combined with neck pain and headache.</p>
          <p><strong>Treatment response:</strong> A systematic review from 2011 concluded that there is moderate evidence for manual treatment of cervicogenic dizziness. Treatment is often combined with specific exercises.</p>

          <h3>3. Vestibular Neuritis</h3>
          <p>An inflammation of the balance nerve, often after a viral infection. Causes sudden, intense dizziness that lasts for days to weeks.</p>
          <p><strong>Treatment response:</strong> Vestibular rehabilitation shows significant effect. A Cochrane review found statistically significant improvement compared to no treatment.</p>

          <h3>4. Other Causes</h3>
          <p>Vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease, medication side effects, and orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure drop when standing) are among other common causes. Sometimes multiple conditions overlap.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #dc2626; margin-top: 0;">Red Flags - Call Emergency Services For:</h3>
            <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
              <li><strong>Sudden severe headache</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Speech problems</strong> or comprehension difficulties</li>
              <li><strong>Paralysis</strong> or numbness in face/arm/leg</li>
              <li><strong>Visual disturbances</strong> (double vision, vision loss)</li>
              <li><strong>Coordination problems</strong> - cannot stand or walk</li>

          <h2>What Can I Offer?</h2>
          <p>At TheBackROM at Majorstua, I specialize in evaluation and treatment of dizziness. I have invested in equipment that makes it possible to diagnose and treat even those who have had challenges elsewhere:</p>

          <h3>TRV Chair</h3>
          <p>A hydraulic treatment chair that can rotate 360 degrees in the plane of each semicircular canal. This makes it possible to treat BPPV in patients who cannot lie flat - elderly, people with neck injuries, or those who get too nauseous from traditional maneuvers.</p>

          <h3>VNG Testing (Videonystagmography)</h3>
          <p>High-resolution video goggles with infrared cameras that register eye movements during various tests. This gives us objective measurements and helps us distinguish between different causes of dizziness.</p>

          <h3>Thorough Neck Examination</h3>
          <p>Assessment of joint mobility, muscle tension, and proprioception to uncover if the neck is contributing to your symptoms.</p>

          <h2>What Can You Expect?</h2>

          <h3>First Consultation (45 minutes)</h3>
          <p>I start with a thorough review of your medical history and symptoms. Then I do a systematic examination including testing of balance, eye movements, and neck. If BPPV is suspected, I perform diagnostic tests like Dix-Hallpike. Based on findings, I discuss a plan together with you.</p>

          <h3>Treatment</h3>
          <p>Treatment depends on the cause:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>BPPV:</strong> Repositioning maneuvers (Epley, Semont). Many experience significant improvement in 1-3 treatments.</li>
            <li><strong>Cervicogenic:</strong> Manual treatment combined with exercises. Typically 4-8 treatments over several weeks.</li>
            <li><strong>Vestibular dysfunction:</strong> Individually tailored rehabilitation program with exercises.</li>
          </ul>
