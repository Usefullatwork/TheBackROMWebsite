              <p>Sever's disease (also called calcaneal apophysitis) occurs when the growth plate in the heel bone
                becomes irritated from repeated stress. It is especially common in children who participate in a lot of
                sports, and is most often seen during periods of rapid growth. In adults with similar symptoms, <a

              <h2>What is Sever's Disease?</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Sever's disease is an overuse condition that affects the growth plate (apophysis) in the heel bone of
              children. The Achilles tendon attaches here, and with repeated stress, the area can become irritated and
              painful. This is different from <a href="stress-fracture-foot.html">stress fracture in the foot</a>, which
              involves an actual bone break.</p>

            <p>The condition is named after American physician James Warren Sever who first described it in 1912. Today,
              the more precise name <strong>calcaneal apophysitis</strong> is often preferred.</p>

              <h3>Why does it occur?</h3>
              <p>During growth spurts, bones grow faster than muscles and tendons. This creates tension where the
                Achilles tendon attaches to the heel bone. The growth plate (apophysis) is weaker than surrounding
                tissue and therefore becomes irritated with repeated stress.</p>

              <span class="section-number">2</span>
              <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Symptoms typically develop gradually and worsen with activity.</p>

            <h3>Common symptoms</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Heel pain</strong> - typically behind and under the heel</li>
              <li><strong>Worsens with activity</strong> - especially running and jumping</li>
              <li><strong>Limping</strong> - especially after training</li>
              <li><strong>Morning stiffness</strong> or after rest</li>
              <li><strong>Tenderness when pressed</strong> on the sides of the heel</li>
              <li><strong>Walking on toes</strong> - the child avoids loading the heel</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Typical pattern</h3>
              <p>Pain is often worst:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>During and after training</li>
                <li>When running on hard surfaces</li>
                <li>When wearing soccer cleats or other sports shoes with low heel height</li>
                <li>During periods of rapid growth</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
              <p>The diagnosis is made clinically based on medical history and examination. The classic "squeeze test"
                (pain when squeezing the sides of the heel) is typically positive.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>X-ray</strong> is usually not necessary, but may be taken to rule out
                other conditions.</p>

            <p>Sever's disease typically occurs when several factors are present at the same time. Many of these risk

            </div>

            <p><strong>No, Sever's disease is completely harmless</strong> and causes no permanent damage. It is a
              common, benign growth pain that resolves on its own when the growth plate in the heel closes.</p>

            <div class="treatment-box">
              <h3>The good news</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>The condition <strong>always</strong> resolves on its own</li>
                <li>No permanent damage or deformities</li>
                <li>Does not affect the child's growth or development</li>
                <li>The child can usually continue with sports (with modifications)</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>The most important thing is to manage the pain so that the child can stay active and avoid long periods
              of inactivity. Complete rest is rarely necessary.</p>

            <p>The goal of treatment is to reduce pain so that the child can maintain activity. Complete rest is rarely

              <h3>Soft tissue treatment</h3>

            <div class="exercise-box">
              <h3>Calf stretching</h3>

              <ol>
                <li>Stand with hands against a wall</li>
                <li>Place the affected leg behind, keep the heel on the floor</li>
                <li>Bend the front knee until you feel a stretch in the calf</li>
                <li>Hold 30 seconds, repeat 3 times</li>
                <li>Do this 2-3 times daily</li>

              <h3>Other measures</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Heel cups/insoles:</strong> Cushion impact and reduce load</li>
                <li><strong>Ice after activity:</strong> 15-20 minutes as needed</li>
                <li><strong>Good shoes:</strong> Shock-absorbing shoes with some heel height</li>
                <li><strong>Activity modification:</strong> Reduce volume rather than stopping completely</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Activity modification</h3>
            <p>Instead of complete rest, modify the activity:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduce training volume and intensity</li>
              <li>Avoid hard surfaces when possible</li>
              <li>Switch to low-impact activities during periods (swimming, cycling)</li>
              <li>Let the child take breaks during training when in pain</li>

            <p><strong>The prognosis is excellent.</strong> All children with Sever's disease fully recover when the

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Does my child have to stop training with Sever's disease?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Not necessarily. Activity should be adapted to the pain level. The child can often
                continue training with reduced intensity and volume. Pain-free activities like swimming and cycling are
                good alternatives during periods with significant symptoms. Complete rest is rarely recommended.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">How long does Sever's disease last?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The condition is self-limiting and resolves when the growth plate closes, usually
                around 12-14 years for girls and 14-16 years for boys. Symptoms can last from a few months to 2 years,
                depending on activity level and treatment. Many have periods of improvement and worsening.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Is Sever's disease dangerous?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">No, Sever's disease is not dangerous and causes no permanent damage. It is a
                common, benign condition caused by growth-related pain. The condition always resolves on its own when
                the child finishes the growth spurt, and there is no risk of long-term problems.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Do heel insoles help with Sever's disease?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes, heel cups or cushioning insoles can help by reducing the load on the growth
                plate. They should be used in both sports shoes and everyday shoes. Prefabricated insoles from the
                pharmacy or sports store often work as well as custom-made ones.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can Sever's disease come back?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes, symptoms can return with increased activity or a new growth spurt. This is
                normal and does not mean the condition has worsened. When the growth plate is closed (usually in the
                teenage years), the condition can no longer occur.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Should we get an X-ray?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Usually not. The diagnosis is made based on medical history and clinical
                examination. X-ray may be considered if symptoms are unusual, don't improve as expected, or to rule out
                other conditions. X-ray doesn't show Sever's disease itself, but can rule out other causes.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can other heel problems be confused with Sever's disease?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes, in adults with similar symptoms, <a href="plantar-fasciopathy.html">plantar
                  fasciopathy</a> and <a href="achilles-tendinopathy.html">Achilles tendinopathy</a> are common
