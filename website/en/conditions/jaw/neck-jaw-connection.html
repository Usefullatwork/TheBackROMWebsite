            <p>In the brainstem, there's an area where nerve signals from the jaw (trigeminal nerve) and upper neck (C1-C3) meet and mix. This is called the trigeminocervical complex, and it explains a lot:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pain crossing:</strong> Signals from the neck can be "misinterpreted" as jaw pain and vice versa</li>
              <li><strong>Referred pain:</strong> A problem in C2 can cause pain in the jaw joint or temple</li>
              <li><strong>Shared sensitization:</strong> Persistent pain from one area can make the other more sensitive</li>

              <h3>Practical Example</h3>
              <p>A patient comes in with "jaw pain" that's worst in the morning. On examination, I find tight and tender upper neck muscles (suboccipital) and limited mobility in C1-C2. After treating the neck - without touching the jaw - the jaw pain is significantly reduced. The cause was referred pain via the TCC.</p>

              <h2>Muscular Connections</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Several muscles affect both neck and jaw directly:</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)</h3>
              <p>Rotates the head but also affects the jaw joint via fascial connections. Often tight in both neck and jaw problems.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Trapezius</h3>
              <p>Shoulder-neck muscle that is often involved in TMD. Tension here can affect head position and thereby the jaw.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Hyoid Muscles</h3>
              <p>Connect jaw, neck, and breastbone. Play an important role in swallowing and jaw position.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Suboccipital Muscles</h3>
              <p>Direct connection to the dura (brain membrane) and trigeminal nucleus. Central in neck-jaw problems.</p>
            </div>

              <h2>Forward Head Posture (FHP)</h2>
            </div>

            <p>One of the most important connections between neck and jaw is posture - specifically what's called forward head posture (FHP). Normally, the ear should be in line with the shoulder when viewed from the side. With FHP, the head is shifted forward.</p>

            <div class="stat-grid">
              <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-number">60-66%</span>

              </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Consequences for the Neck</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>For every 2.5 cm the head moves forward, the load on the neck increases by about 4.5 kg</li>
              <li>With typical FHP, the load can increase by 60% or more</li>
              <li>Neck muscles must work constantly to hold the head up</li>
              <li>Upper cervical vertebrae compress backward (extension)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consequences for the Jaw</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The lower jaw is pulled back and down</li>
              <li>Jaw muscles activate compensatorily to keep the mouth closed</li>
              <li>The jaw joint is loaded asymmetrically</li>
              <li>Increased risk of <a href="bruxism.html">teeth grinding</a> (bruxism)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="red-flag-alert">
              <h3>Vicious Cycle</h3>
              <p>FHP leads to increased neck load, neck muscles tighten, suboccipital muscles compress C1-C2, referred pain to jaw via TCC, jaw muscles tighten in response, increased load on jaw joint, more pain, more muscle tightness, worse posture. The cycle must be broken at multiple points.</p>

              <h2>Whiplash and TMD</h2>
            </div>

            <p>If you've experienced a neck injury - for example in a car accident - you have significantly higher risk of jaw joint problems:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>5.5 times higher risk</strong> of TMD after whiplash (Haggman-Henrikson et al.)</li>
              <li>Symptoms can appear <strong>weeks to months</strong> after the injury itself</li>
              <li>Often overlooked in the acute phase because focus is on the neck</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why Whiplash Causes TMD</h3>
            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Direct Injury</h3>
              <p>The jaw is thrown back and forth during the accident. Jaw muscles can be directly injured and the jaw joint's capsular ligaments can be stretched.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Central Sensitization</h3>
              <p>Persistent neck pain makes the jaw more sensitive via the TCC connection.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Reflexive Tightening</h3>
              <p>Jaw muscles tighten as a protective reaction after trauma.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Important for You with Previous Neck Injury</h3>
              <p>If you've had whiplash and now experience jaw pain (especially when chewing), clicking in the jaw joint, limited opening ability, or headache radiating from neck to temple/jaw - these symptoms should be seen in connection with your neck injury.</p>

              <h3>Conclusion from Research</h3>
              <p>Treating only the jaw in TMD is often insufficient. The best approach is to examine and treat the entire system: jaw joint, jaw muscles, upper cervical vertebrae, and neck muscles. Posture guidance and ergonomic adaptation are important additional components.</p>

            <p>The following patterns may indicate that the neck is contributing to your jaw problems:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Jaw pain that's worse in the morning (neck position during sleep)</li>

              <li>Improvement of jaw symptoms with neck stretching</li>
              <li>Previous whiplash or neck injury</li>

            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Why do so many with jaw problems also have neck problems?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Nerve fibers from the jaw (trigeminal) and upper neck (C1-C3) meet in the trigeminocervical complex in the brainstem. This means pain signals can cross between areas - neck problems can be perceived as jaw pain and vice versa.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can forward head posture cause jaw problems?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes. When the head pushes forward, the load on neck muscles increases by up to 60%. This postural change activates jaw muscles compensatorily and changes the jaw's resting position. Studies show that 60-66% of office workers have forward head posture.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can neck injury cause jaw joint problems later?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes. Research shows that people with previous neck injury (whiplash) have 5.5 times higher risk of developing TMD. Symptoms can appear weeks to months after the injury itself.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Does neck treatment help jaw pain?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Often yes. Studies show that treatment of upper cervical vertebrae (C0-C2) can reduce jaw pain, and that combined treatment of neck and jaw gives better results than jaw treatment alone.</div>
