                <h2>What is Pregnancy-Related Back Pain?</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Back and pelvic pain during pregnancy is so common that it's almost considered a normal part of
                pregnancy. A large meta-analysis from 2023 found that approximately <strong>40% of pregnant women
                  experience lower back pain</strong>. When pelvic pain is included, the figure rises to around 63%.</p>

                <div class="stat-item">
                  <div class="stat-number">~50%</div>

                </div>
              </div>

              <p>You may have heard that "9 out of 10 pregnant women get back pain." This is exaggerated - research
                shows that about half experience pain bothersome enough to affect daily life.</p>

              <p>The pain typically starts <strong>between weeks 20 and 28</strong>, and often becomes more intense as
                pregnancy progresses.</p>

                <h2>Pelvic Girdle Pain vs. SI Joint Dysfunction</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Many use "pelvic girdle pain" as a catch-all term, but there are actually two different conditions that
                require different approaches.</p>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Pelvic Girdle Pain (symphysis pubis dysfunction)</h3>
                <p>This is the most common variant during pregnancy and is caused by the hormone relaxin making the
                  ligaments in the pelvis more elastic. The body prepares for delivery, but the increased mobility can
                  cause pain.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Diffuse, often bilateral pain in the front of the pelvis (over the symphysis)</li>
                  <li>"Waddling gait"</li>
                  <li>About 20% of pregnant women experience troublesome pelvic pain</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>SI Joint Dysfunction</h3>
                <p>Here the problem is the opposite - one or more joints in the pelvis have reduced mobility.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Often one-sided, sharp pain in the back of the pelvis</li>
                  <li>Typically localized to one sacroiliac joint</li>
                  <li>Pain may radiate to the buttock, groin, or thigh</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                <p>Treatment differs. For pelvic girdle pain, I focus on stabilizing exercises, while SI joint
                  dysfunction often responds well to joint mobilization.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Section 3: Causes -->
            <section id="causes" class="hub-section">
              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">3</span>
                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Pregnancy-related back pain has several intertwined causes:</p>

              <h3>Hormonal Changes</h3>
              <p>The hormone relaxin loosens ligaments and connective tissue to prepare the body for delivery. This
                makes the pelvic joints more unstable and can cause pain.</p>

              <h3>Changed Posture</h3>
              <p>As the belly grows, the center of gravity shifts forward. Many compensate by arching the lower back
                more, which increases the load on facet joints and muscles.</p>

              <h3>Increased Weight and Load</h3>
              <p>Weight gain of 10-15 kg during pregnancy means significantly increased load on the lower back and
                pelvis.</p>

              <div class="red-flag-alert">
                <h3>Who is at highest risk?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Previous back pain:</strong> 85% chance of experiencing it again in a new pregnancy</li>
                  <li><strong>Back problems before pregnancy:</strong> Twice the risk</li>
                  <li><strong>Overweight:</strong> BMI over 25 increases risk</li>
                  <li><strong>Heavy physical work:</strong> Norwegian studies show a connection</li>
                  <li><strong>Multiple pregnancies:</strong> Risk increases with each pregnancy</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Sciatica during pregnancy is rarer than many think</strong> - only about 1% of pregnant women
                have confirmed sciatica. Much of what is called "sciatica" is actually referred pain from the pelvis or
                muscles.</p>

              </div>

              <h3>For Pelvic Girdle Pain</h3>
              <ul class="symptom-list">
                <li>Pain in front of the pelvis, over the symphysis</li>
                <li>Pain is often diffuse and can be felt on both sides</li>
                <li>Worse with walking, stairs, turning in bed</li>
                <li>Feeling that the pelvis is "unstable"</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>For Lower Back Pain</h3>
              <ul class="symptom-list">
                <li>Aching pain in the lower back</li>
                <li>Often localized to the sacroiliac joints</li>
                <li>Can radiate to buttock and back of thigh</li>
                <li>Rarely below the knee (which distinguishes it from true sciatica)</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>With Combination</h3>
                <p>Many experience a combination of both, which can be particularly challenging. Combined pain often
                  causes the greatest functional impairment.</p>

              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">5</span>
                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Diagnosis is made primarily through medical history and clinical examination. European guidelines for
                pelvic pain recommend specific tests:</p>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Important Clinical Tests</h3>
                <p>Two tests are particularly valuable for assessing SI joint problems during pregnancy:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>P4 test (Posterior Pelvic Pain Provocation):</strong> A test with high diagnostic value
                    for detecting sacroiliac joint problems</li>
                  <li><strong>ASLR test (Active Straight Leg Raise):</strong> Assesses functional stability in the
                    pelvis</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Important:</strong> When both P4 and ASLR are positive, the risk of
                  long-term complaints is more than 7 times higher.</p>
              </div>

              <p><strong>Imaging (X-ray, MRI):</strong> Rarely necessary and avoided during pregnancy due to radiation.
                Clinical examination usually provides sufficient information to start treatment.</p>

            <!-- Section 6: Treatment -->
            <section id="treatment" class="hub-section">
              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">6</span>
                <h2>Treatment</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>
              <p>Chiropractic treatment during pregnancy is safe when performed with adapted techniques. A systematic
                review from Cochrane found moderate evidence that manual treatment can reduce pain and improve function
                in pregnant women.</p>

              <div class="stat-highlight">
                <p>A study by Peterson et al. (2014) found that <strong>52% of pregnant women reported improvement after
                    just one week</strong> of chiropractic treatment.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="treatment-box">
                <h3>Typical Treatment Methods</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Gentle joint mobilization of pelvis and lower back</li>
                  <li>Soft tissue treatment of tight muscles</li>
                  <li>Guidance in exercises and posture</li>
                  <li>Pregnancy pillows or side-lying positions to avoid pressure on the abdomen</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h3>What can you do yourself?</h3>
              <ul class="symptom-list">
                <li><strong>Stabilizing exercises:</strong> Norwegian research shows that 68% had minimal or no pain
                  after exercise treatment</li>
                <li><strong>Stay active:</strong> Moderate activity like swimming and walking is often better than rest
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pillow between knees:</strong> Relieves the pelvis when you sleep on your side</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid asymmetric loads:</strong> Sit down when putting on pants</li>
                <li><strong>Pelvic belt:</strong> Can provide support for pelvic girdle pain</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Treatment Course</h3>
              <p>Research shows that many experience improvement relatively quickly. One study reported that patients
                needed an average of <strong>1.8 treatments</strong> before noticing clear improvement.</p>
              <p>Many pregnant women benefit from treatment every 2-4 weeks throughout pregnancy, with more frequent
                visits as needed.</p>

              </div>

              <p>Most improve significantly after giving birth. A large Danish study found that <strong>67-75% were
                  symptom-free three months after delivery</strong>, and over 90% after two years.</p>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Important to Know</h3>
                <p>Prognosis depends on several factors:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Women with pain in all three pelvic joints have a poorer prognosis - about 20% still have
                    complaints after two years</li>
                  <li>Norwegian guidelines recommend specialized physiotherapy if complaints are not significantly
                    better six weeks after delivery</li>
                  <li>The risk of getting pelvic pain in the next pregnancy is high - about 85% experience the
                    complaints again</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="stat-highlight">
                <p>Early treatment and exercises can still significantly reduce severity.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is it safe to see a chiropractor when pregnant?</h3>
                <p>Yes, chiropractic treatment is considered safe throughout pregnancy when performed by an experienced
                  practitioner who adapts the techniques. A literature review found very few reported side effects.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I start treatment?</h3>
                <p>You don't need to wait. Early treatment often leads to faster improvement, and preventive measures
                  can reduce the risk of symptoms becoming chronic.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can the chiropractor treat me in all trimesters?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but techniques are adapted. In the third trimester, I use side-lying positions and special
                  equipment to avoid pressure on the abdomen, and I take extra care due to increased ligament laxity.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What is the difference between pelvic girdle pain and regular back pain?</h3>
                <p>Pelvic girdle pain typically causes pain in front of the pelvis and worsens with walking and stairs.
                  Regular back pain is located higher up and is often related to muscles and posture.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Will the pain go away after giving birth?</h3>
                <p>For most, yes. About 75% are symptom-free three months after delivery. Some have long-term
                  complaints, especially those with pain in all three pelvic joints.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can exercises replace treatment?</h3>
                <p>Exercises are an important part of treatment and can often provide good results on their own. The
                  combination of manual treatment and exercises often gives the best results.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Does insurance cover chiropractic care during pregnancy?</h3>
                <p>Most private health insurance policies cover chiropractic treatment. Check with your insurance
                  company for details about coverage.</p>
