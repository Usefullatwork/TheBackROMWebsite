              <ul>
                <li><strong>Usually harmless:</strong> Crepitus (cracking) in the neck is very common and rarely a sign
                  of anything serious</li>
                <li><strong>Common causes:</strong> Gas bubbles from joints, tendons sliding over bone, or normal
                  age-related changes</li>
                <li><strong>No pain = no worry:</strong> If your neck cracks without pain or other symptoms, it is
                  usually completely normal</li>
                <li><strong>Don't crack your own neck:</strong> Avoid actively cracking your neck - it can lead to
                  overstretching of ligaments</li>
                <li class="warning"><strong>Seek help if:</strong> The cracking is accompanied by pain, swelling,
                  weakness or numbness in the arms</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">What is Crepitus?</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Crepitus is the medical term for sounds that occur in joints and soft tissue during movement. In the
                neck, this can sound like cracking, popping, clicking or grinding. The sounds can vary from a single
                "click" to a series of cracking sounds.</p>

              <p>This is a very common phenomenon - studies show that <strong>up to 45% of the population experience
                  sounds from the neck during movement</strong>. It naturally increases with age, and most cases are
                completely harmless.</p>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Did you know?</h4>
                <p>The characteristic "pop" sound when a joint cracks is caused by gas bubbles (mainly nitrogen and
                  carbon dioxide) being released from the joint fluid. This is called cavitation and is completely
                  harmless. It takes about 20 minutes for the gas bubbles to form again.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <section id="causes" class="hub-section">
              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">2</span>
                <h2 class="section-title">Why Does the Neck Crack?</h2>
              </div>

              <p>There are several explanations for why the neck makes sounds. Most are completely harmless and require
                no treatment.</p>

              <h3>Harmless Causes</h3>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h4>1. Cavitation (gas bubbles)</h4>
                <p>When a joint is stretched, the pressure in the joint capsule drops. This causes gases dissolved in
                  the joint fluid to be released as bubbles, creating an audible "pop" or click sound. This is the same
                  mechanism as when a chiropractor adjusts a joint.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h4>2. Tendons and ligaments</h4>
                <p>Tendons and ligaments can slide over bony structures or each other during movement. This often
                  creates a "snapping" or sliding sound, especially when the neck has been in the same position for a
                  long time.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h4>3. Facet joints</h4>
                <p>The neck has many small joints (facet joints) between the vertebrae. When these joints move, they can
                  produce sounds - especially if the joints are stiff or there is slight asymmetry in movement.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h4>4. Age-related changes</h4>
                <p>With age, the cartilage surface in joints becomes slightly rougher, and this can cause a grinding or
                  crunching sound during movement. This is normal and does not mean you have "worn out" your neck.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>When Can It Be More Than Normal?</h3>
              <p>In rare cases, neck cracking can be related to underlying conditions:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> <a href="degenerative-changes.html">Wear and tear</a> in the joints
                  can cause grinding, but this is usually accompanied by stiffness and pain</li>
                <li><strong>Disc degeneration:</strong> When the discs between the vertebrae lose height, it can affect
                  joint mechanics</li>
                <li><strong>Instability:</strong> With hypermobility, the joints can move more than normal and make
                  sounds</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="harmless" class="hub-section">
              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">3</span>
                <h2 class="section-title">When Is It Harmless?</h2>
              </div>

              <p>In the vast majority of cases, neck cracking is completely harmless. Here are signs that you don't need
                to worry:</p>

              <div class="prognosis-box">
                <h4>Safe sign - You can relax if:</h4>
                <p>
                  - The cracking is <strong>not accompanied by pain</strong><br>
                  - You have <strong>full mobility</strong> in your neck<br>
                  - There is <strong>no swelling</strong> or warmth<br>
                  - You have <strong>no radiating symptoms</strong> to your arms<br>
                  - The cracking has <strong>been there for a long time</strong> without worsening
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Research shows</h4>
                <p>Studies have found no connection between joint sounds and increased risk of osteoarthritis or other
                  degenerative conditions. In other words: the sound itself does no harm.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <section id="self-cracking" class="hub-section">

                <h2 class="section-title">Should I Crack My Own Neck?</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Many experience temporary relief when they crack their own neck. But it's important to distinguish
                between incidental cracking during movement and actively manipulating the neck to make it crack.</p>

              <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Not recommended: Actively cracking your own neck</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Repeated self-manipulation can lead to <strong>hypermobility</strong> over time</li>
                  <li>You risk overstretching <strong>ligaments and capsules</strong></li>
                  <li>It can create a <strong>habit</strong> where you feel the need to crack more and more often</li>
                  <li>You often manipulate the <strong>wrong segment</strong> - the one that is already too mobile</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <p>If you feel a need to crack your neck often, it may be a sign that some joints are stiff while others
                compensate by being too mobile. A chiropractor can assess this and treat the actual problem areas.</p>

              <div class="treatment-box">
                <h4>Better alternatives:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Gentle stretching exercises for the neck</li>
                  <li>Regular movement breaks during screen work</li>
                  <li>Strengthening exercises for neck and shoulder muscles</li>
                  <li>Professional assessment by a chiropractor if stiffness persists</li>

                <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Is neck cracking dangerous?</h4>
                <p>No, usually not. Crepitus (cracking) in the neck is very common and often caused by gas bubbles being
                  released from joints, tendons sliding over bone, or normal age-related changes. It is rarely a sign of
                  anything serious.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why does my neck make sounds?</h4>
                <p>The most common causes are: 1) Gas bubbles being released from joint fluid (cavitation), 2) Tendons
                  or ligaments sliding over bony structures, 3) Facet joints moving, 4) Mild degeneration which is
                  completely normal with age.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>When should I seek help for neck cracking?</h4>
                <p>You should seek help if the cracking is accompanied by pain, swelling, reduced mobility, numbness or
                  weakness in the arms, or if it occurred after an injury.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Can I crack my own neck?</h4>
                <p>It is not recommended to actively crack your own neck. While the occasional sound during movement is
                  harmless, repeated self-manipulation can lead to hypermobility and instability over time.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Does cracking mean I have osteoarthritis?</h4>
                <p>No, not necessarily. Cracking alone is not a sign of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis usually also
                  causes other symptoms such as pain, stiffness and reduced mobility.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h4>Why do I feel relief when my neck cracks?</h4>
                <p>When a joint "pops," endorphins are released that provide a short-term feeling of relief.
                  Additionally, stretching of the joint capsule can lead to reflex relaxation of surrounding muscles.
