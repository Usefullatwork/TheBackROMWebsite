What we know is that many patients have tender points in their muscles that produce recognizable radiation patterns, and that treatment targeting these points often provides symptom relief. Norwegian researchers have noted that the diagnostics have limited reliability, but this doesn't mean your pain isn't real."

              <p>Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a condition where painful knots - called trigger points - develop in
                muscles and fascia. These points are tender to pressure and can cause pain that radiates to other areas
                of the body. A trigger point in the upper trapezius, for example, can cause headache up toward the
                temple.</p>

              <p>The condition is very common. Among patients with chronic <a href="../../neck-pain.html">neck pain</a>,
                <strong>88-100%</strong> have at least one trigger point (Cerezo-Tellez 2016; Ezzati 2021). In pain
                clinics, up to 85% of patients have a myofascial component.

                <h2>Key Points</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Tender, tight points in muscle tissue that can cause local pain and
                  radiation to other areas</li>
                <li><strong>Prevalence:</strong> 88-100% of patients with chronic neck pain have trigger points</li>
                <li><strong>Most common muscles:</strong> Upper trapezius (93%), levator scapulae, sternocleidomastoid,
                  scalenes</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Manual treatment and dry needling often provide short-term relief.
                  Combined stretching and strength training is most important for lasting improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Unexplained weight loss, fever, neurological symptoms, gait disturbances
                  - see a doctor</li>

              <span class="section-number">1</span>
              <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Trigger points develop near muscle fibers that become overloaded or damaged. The most common causes,
              ranked by frequency:</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Static Loading and Poor Ergonomics (Most Common)</h3>
              <p>Prolonged desk work, screen use with forward head position, and repetitive work are by far the most
                common causes. Office workers and manual laborers have similar trigger point distribution, with an
                average of 6 active and 10-11 latent trigger points (Fernandez-De-Las-Penas 2012).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Muscular Overload</h3>
              <p>Repetitive movements, heavy lifting, or sudden increased training load.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Stress and Tension</h3>
              <p>Psychological stress often leads to chronic muscle tension, especially in the neck and shoulders.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Other Factors</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sleep problems and fatigue:</strong> Poor sleep reduces the muscles' ability to recover</li>
                <li><strong>Vitamin D deficiency:</strong> About one-third of MPS patients have low vitamin D levels
                  (StatPearls 2025)</li>
                <li><strong>Trauma:</strong> Whiplash and other injuries. Among whiplash patients, 55-65% have trigger
                  points in levator scapulae</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Who is affected?</h3>
              <p>MPS occurs most often in the 27-50 age group. Women are affected more often than men - 65% versus 37%
                among middle-aged adults (Steen, Muscle & Nerve 2025).</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Local Tenderness</h3>
              <p>A distinct point that is very tender to pressure.</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Referred Pain</h3>
              <p>Pain radiates in a predictable pattern. Upper trapezius often causes pain toward the back of the head
                and temple. Sternocleidomastoid can cause pain around the eye and forehead.</p>

              <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Diagnosis is made through clinical examination. An international Delphi study from 2018 with 60 experts
              from 12 countries concluded that the most important diagnostic criteria are: a taut band in the muscle, a
              hypersensitive point, and reproduction of referred pain with pressure (Fernandez-de-las-Penas & Dommerholt
              2018).</p>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Important to know</h3>
              <p>There are no internationally validated diagnostic criteria for MPS. Inter-examiner reliability is only
                moderate. This means that two practitioners examining the same patient may find trigger points in
                slightly different locations. We therefore use the clinical examination as a starting point, but also
                emphasize your experience and response to treatment.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Imaging</h3>
            <p>MRI and X-ray are rarely necessary for trigger points. Images often show age-related changes (wear,
              degeneration) that don't explain your pain. Ultrasound can detect trigger points as darker areas with
              increased stiffness, but this is currently mostly used in research.</p>

              <h2>Treatment</h2>
            </div>

            <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>

            <p>A network meta-analysis from 2024 including 40 randomized studies and 2227 participants shows that manual
              treatment provides short-term improvement in pain, pressure sensitivity and function (Liu et al. 2024).
              Evidence quality is classified as low according to the GRADE system, but the effects are clinically
              relevant for many patients.</p>

            <div class="treatment-box">
              <h3>Treatment I offer includes:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ischemic compression:</strong> Sustained pressure on the trigger point. A 2022 meta-analysis
                  shows significant improvement in pressure pain threshold (Lu et al. 2022)</li>
                <li><strong>Dry needling:</strong> Thin needles are inserted directly into the trigger point. Equally
                  effective as manual trigger point treatment in short and medium term (Lew et al. 2021)</li>
                <li><strong>Myofascial techniques and mobilization:</strong> Soft tissue treatment of muscles and fascia
                </li>
                <li><strong>Joint mobilization/manipulation:</strong> For concurrent joint dysfunction in the neck or
                  thoracic spine</li>
                <li><strong>Exercise-based rehabilitation:</strong> The most important for lasting improvement</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Honest expectations</h3>
              <p>Short-term treatment effects are well documented. Long-term effects (6-12 months) are less well
                studied, and at this time horizon there is little difference between different treatment methods. What
                gives the best lasting effect is combining treatment with self-exercise and addressing underlying
                factors like stress, ergonomics and sleep.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What can you do yourself?</h3>

            <p>A 2017 systematic review shows that combined stretching and strength training provides the best effect on
              myofascial pain (Mata Diz et al. 2017):</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Stretching</h3>
              <p>Hold for 30 seconds - this is the optimal duration according to research (Mansoori et al. 2021).
                Stretch trapezius, levator scapulae and scalenes daily.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Strength Training</h3>
              <p>Exercises for deep neck muscles and shoulder blade stabilizers. I'll show you specific exercises
                tailored to your trigger points.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
              <p>Screen at eye level, forearms supported, regular breaks. Avoid forward head position.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Self-massage</h3>
              <p>Use a tennis ball or lacrosse ball against the wall for gentle pressure on tender points. 30-60 seconds
                per point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Heat and Stress Management</h3>
              <p>Heat can provide temporary relief and increase blood flow. Chronic stress maintains muscle tension -
                consider breathing techniques, mindfulness or other relaxation methods.</p>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Acute Problems (&lt;6 weeks)</h3>
              <p>Often 3-6 treatments over 2-4 weeks, with gradual transition to self-exercise.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="condition-card">
              <h3>Chronic Problems (&gt;12 weeks)</h3>
              <p>May require longer treatment period. Focus on identifying and addressing maintaining factors.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You don't need to wait to seek help. Early treatment often leads to faster improvement than "waiting it

              <h2>Prognosis</h2>
            </div>

            <p>Most people with trigger points in the neck experience good improvement with treatment and self-exercise.
              Short-term treatment effects are well documented in research.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>Recurrence is common</h3>
              <p>Without addressing underlying factors like ergonomics, stress, inactivity and potential nutritional
                deficiencies, trigger points often return. This is why we place great emphasis on self-exercise and
                lifestyle factors.</p>
            </div>

            <p>At 6-12 months, long-term results are often similar regardless of which specific treatment method was
              used. What appears most important for lasting improvement is the combination of treatment, exercises and
              adjustment of activity and ergonomics.</p>

              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Do trigger points actually exist?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">There is ongoing professional debate about the exact nature and pathophysiology of
                trigger points. What we know is that many patients have tender points in their muscles that produce
                recognizable radiation patterns, and that treatment targeting these points often provides symptom
                relief. Norwegian researchers have noted that the diagnostics have limited reliability, but this doesn't
                mean your pain isn't real.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between trigger points and fibromyalgia?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Trigger points cause localized pain with specific radiation from defined points in
                muscles. Fibromyalgia is a condition with widespread pain across large parts of the body for more than 3
                months, often combined with fatigue, sleep problems and cognitive fog. The two conditions can also occur
                together.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Does dry needling hurt?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">The needles used are very thin (about like acupuncture needles). Most people
                experience a small prick at insertion, and a characteristic "twitch" when the trigger point is hit. This
                discomfort is brief. Some experience soreness in the area for 1-2 days afterward, similar to after hard
                exercise.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">How many treatments do I need?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">It varies. For acute problems, we often see improvement after 3-6 treatments. For
                long-standing problems, it may take longer, and the focus is then more on finding and addressing the
                factors maintaining the problem. We always evaluate along the way and adjust the treatment plan based on
                your response.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can trigger points cause dizziness?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes, trigger points in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) can cause dizziness, balance
                disturbances and a feeling that surroundings are moving. This is likely due to effects on proprioceptors
                (position sense) in the neck muscles. We always investigate other causes of dizziness before concluding
                it's due to trigger points.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Is massage or chiropractic better for trigger points?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Research shows that different manual techniques - including massage, trigger point
                therapy, dry needling and mobilization - have similar effects in the short term. What's most important
                is that treatment is combined with exercises and that underlying factors are addressed. As a
                chiropractor, I can offer a wide range of techniques and tailor treatment to your needs.</div>
