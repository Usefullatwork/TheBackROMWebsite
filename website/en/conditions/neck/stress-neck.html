              <p>"Stress neck" is not a medical diagnosis, but a descriptive term for <a
                  href="../../neck-pain.html">neck pain</a> and muscle tension strongly linked to psychological stress.
                It is one of the most common causes of neck pain among office workers and others with sedentary
                occupations.</p>
              <p>When we experience stress, the body activates the "fight-or-flight" response. Part of this response is
                increased muscle tension - especially in the neck, shoulders and jaw. Over time, persistent tension can
                lead to the development of <a href="neck-trigger-points.html">trigger points</a>, pain and reduced
                mobility.</p>

                <h2>Key Points</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Muscle tension and trigger points in neck/shoulders caused by stress
                  and poor posture</li>
                <li><strong>Common symptoms:</strong> Tight neck, tension headache, tender knots, pain between shoulder
                  blades</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Trigger point therapy, mobilization, exercises and stress management
                </li>
                <li><strong>Prognosis:</strong> Good with treatment - but often requires lifestyle changes for lasting
                  improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Important:</strong> Chronic stress can maintain pain even after treatment</li>

                <h2>What is stress neck?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Stress neck describes a condition where psychological stress manifests as physical tension in the neck
                and shoulder muscles. When we experience stress, the body activates the "fight-or-flight" response which
                increases muscle tension - especially in the neck, shoulders and jaw.</p>

              <div class="stress-cycle-box">
                <h3>The Stress-Tension-Pain Cycle</h3>
                <p>Many get caught in a vicious cycle:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Stress</strong> - increased muscle tension</li>
                  <li><strong>Tension</strong> - trigger points and pain</li>
                  <li><strong>Pain</strong> - more stress and worry</li>
                  <li><strong>More stress</strong> - even more tension</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Treatment often needs to address multiple links in this cycle for lasting improvement.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>What are trigger points?</h3>
              <p>Trigger points are hypersensitive areas in muscle tissue that feel like hard knots when palpated. They
                have two important characteristics:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Local tenderness:</strong> The point is painful when pressed</li>
                <li><strong>Referred pain:</strong> Pressing the point can trigger pain in other areas - e.g., trigger
                  points in the trapezius can cause headache</li>
              </ul>

              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Psychosocial stress</h3>
                <p>Work pressure, conflicts, financial worries and other stressors activate the body's stress response
                  and increase muscle tension.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Poor work posture</h3>
                <p>Forward head position in front of screens, raised shoulders at keyboard work, and lack of movement
                  throughout the day.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Sleep deprivation</h3>
                <p>Poor sleep reduces muscles' ability to recover and increases sensitivity to pain.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Inactivity</h3>
                <p>Lack of physical activity weakens muscles and makes them more vulnerable to overload.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Common trigger point locations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Upper trapezius:</strong> Between neck and shoulder - causes referred pain to temple and eye
                </li>
                <li><strong>Levator scapulae:</strong> From neck to shoulder blade - causes stiff neck and pain with
                  rotation</li>
                <li><strong>Suboccipital muscles:</strong> At the base of skull - causes headache behind the eye</li>
                <li><strong>Sternocleidomastoid:</strong> Front of neck - causes dizziness, blurred vision and headache
                </li>
              </ul>

                <li><strong>Tender muscles:</strong> Painful when touching neck and shoulders</li>
                <li><strong>Tension headache:</strong> Often band-like pressure around the head</li>
                <li><strong>Pain between shoulder blades:</strong> Burning or aching sensation</li>
                <li><strong>Raised shoulders:</strong> Involuntary raising of shoulders toward ears</li>
                <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Feeling of exhaustion in neck and shoulders</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Aggravating factors</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Prolonged computer work</li>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
              </div>

              <div class="treatment-box">
                <h3>Chiropractic treatment may include:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Trigger point therapy:</strong> Targeted pressure to release active trigger points</li>
                  <li><strong>Manual mobilization:</strong> Restore normal joint mobility in neck</li>
                  <li><strong>Soft tissue treatment:</strong> Massage and myofascial techniques</li>
                  <li><strong>Dry needling:</strong> Needle treatment of trigger points</li>
                  <li><strong>Exercise instruction:</strong> Home exercises for strength and relaxation</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h3>Exercises you can do yourself</h3>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Neck stretches</h3>
                <p>Gently tilt your head toward one shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat to the opposite side. Do 3
                  times each side, several times daily.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Shoulder rolls</h3>
                <p>Roll your shoulders slowly backward in large circles. Do 10 repetitions. This loosens tension in the
                  upper trapezius.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Chin tucks</h3>
                <p>Pull your chin straight back as if making a "double chin." Hold for 5 seconds. Repeat 10 times.
                  Corrects forward head posture.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Breathing exercises</h3>
                <p>Deep diaphragmatic breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system and reduces muscle tension.
                  Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 6 seconds. Repeat for 5 minutes.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Stress management</h3>
              <p>For lasting improvement, underlying stress often needs to be addressed:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Regular physical activity</li>
                <li>Adequate sleep (7-9 hours)</li>
                <li>Relaxation techniques (meditation, yoga)</li>
                <li>Social support and work-life balance</li>
                <li>If needed: Professional help for stress management</li>
              </ul>

                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                <p>Most people experience good improvement with treatment. The challenge often lies in preventing
                  relapse, which requires ongoing focus on ergonomics, exercises and stress management.</p>

                <h2>Prevention and Ergonomics</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>Workplace ergonomics</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Screen height:</strong> Top of screen at eye level</li>
                <li><strong>Distance:</strong> Arm's length to screen</li>
                <li><strong>Chair:</strong> Support for lower back, feet flat on floor</li>
                <li><strong>Keyboard and mouse:</strong> Elbows at 90 degrees, relaxed shoulders</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Break routines</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Micro-break every 20-30 minutes (look away from screen, move neck)</li>
                <li>Longer break every hour (stand up, walk around)</li>
                <li>Movement breaks 2-3 times during the workday</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>The 20-20-20 rule</h3>
                <p>Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 meters away for 20 seconds. This reduces strain on eyes and
                  neck during screen work.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>What is the connection between stress and neck pain?</h3>
              <p>Stress activates the body's fight-or-flight response which increases muscle tension, especially in the
                neck and shoulders. Chronic stress leads to persistent muscle tension that creates trigger points and
                pain.</p>

              <h3>What are trigger points?</h3>
              <p>Trigger points are hypersensitive areas in muscles that feel like hard knots. They can cause local pain
                and referred pain to other areas - for example, trigger points in the neck can cause headache.</p>

              <h3>How is stress neck treated?</h3>
              <p>Treatment combines manual therapy (trigger point treatment, mobilization, massage), exercises for
                strength and mobility, ergonomic advice, and stress management techniques.</p>

              <h3>Can I release trigger points myself?</h3>
              <p>Yes, self-massage with a tennis ball or foam roller can help. Place the ball between your shoulder
                blade and wall, and roll gently over tender points. Hold pressure on tender points for 30-60 seconds.
              </p>

              <h3>How long does it take to get rid of stress neck?</h3>
              <p>Acute symptoms can be relieved in 1-3 treatments. Lasting improvement often requires 4-8 weeks of
                treatment combined with exercises and lifestyle changes.</p>
