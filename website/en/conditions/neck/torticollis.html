                <h2>What is acute torticollis?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Acute torticollis - often called "wry neck" or "stiff neck" - is a sudden condition where the neck
                muscles spasm and the head becomes "locked" in a crooked position. You typically wake up in the morning
                with pain on one side of the neck and cannot move your head normally.</p>
              <p>The condition is very common. According to StatPearls (2023), approximately <strong>90% of the
                  population</strong> will experience at least one episode during their lifetime, and about 70% get <a
                  href="../../neck-pain.html">neck pain</a> at some point. A Swedish study from Northern Sweden (Guez,
                2002) found that 43% of the population reported neck pain - 48% of women and 38% of men.</p>
              <p>Acute torticollis most often affects younger people between 12 and 30 years old (Physio Network;
                Counsell, 2016), and women are affected about twice as often as men. The positive news is that the
                condition almost always resolves on its own within 1-2 weeks.</p>

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
              </div>
              <p>In most cases, no clear cause is found - the condition appears "suddenly" without warning. However,
                there are several known triggering factors:</p>

              <div class="cause-category">
                <h3>Most common (majority of cases)</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Idiopathic/unknown cause</strong> - most have no identifiable trigger (Patient.info, 2023)
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Facet joint dysfunction</strong> - "locking" in the neck joints, the most accepted
                    mechanism (Physio Network)</li>
                  <li><strong>Sleeping position</strong> - awkward position or poor pillow support (Patient.info, 2023)
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Minor muscle strain</strong> - slight overload of neck muscles</li>
                  <li><strong>Rapid neck movements</strong> - sudden twisting or movement</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="cause-category">
                <h4>Less common</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Discogenic irritation</strong> - cervical disc problem causing gradual onset stiff neck
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Post-viral/Upper respiratory infection</strong> - infection triggering swelling and muscle
                    spasms</li>
                  <li><strong>Trauma</strong> - accounts for 10-20% of all torticollis cases, including <a
                      href="whiplash.html">whiplash</a> (Medscape, 2024)</li>
                  <li><strong>Drug-induced</strong> - acute dystonia from certain medications (phenothiazines,
                    metoclopramide, haloperidol)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, retropharyngeal abscess, tumors in neck or posterior fossa. These
                  conditions require medical evaluation and are very rare.</p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Typically you wake up in the morning with symptoms without being able to point to any clear trigger.
                Some experience it after a long car trip, flight, or after sleeping in an unfamiliar bed.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>One-sided neck pain</strong> - which can radiate up toward the head or down toward the
                  shoulder, and sometimes cause <a href="../../dizziness/cervicogenic-dizziness.html">dizziness</a></li>
                <li><strong>Limited movement</strong> - the head is "locked" tilted toward the painful side, with the
                  chin rotated the opposite way</li>
                <li><strong>Pain-free at rest</strong> - you can often find a position where it doesn't hurt</li>
                <li><strong>Muscle tightness</strong> - neck muscles (especially trapezius and sternocleidomastoid) feel
                  tight and tender</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Facet joint vs. discogenic torticollis</h3>
                <p>With facet joint problems, symptom onset is sudden and you can find a comfortable position. With
                  discogenic cause, pain comes on more gradually, and it's difficult to find rest.</p>

            <section id="diagnosis" class="content-section">

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
              </div>
              <p>For typical acute torticollis without warning signs, the diagnosis is clinical - meaning the
                chiropractor makes the diagnosis based on medical history and physical examination. Imaging is usually
                not necessary.</p>

              <h3>When is imaging appropriate?</h3>
              <p>According to guidelines from AAFP (2020) and Royal Children's Hospital (2020), X-ray or MRI may be
                appropriate if:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Symptoms don't improve within 1-2 weeks</li>
                <li>You have neurological symptoms (weakness, numbness, walking problems)</li>
                <li>There has been trauma</li>
                <li>You have fever or other systemic symptoms</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Important to know</h3>
                <p>MRI and X-ray often show "findings" like wear and degenerative changes - this is normal in most
                  adults and rarely explains your pain. Clinical examination often provides more useful information than
                  images.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

              <div class="section-header">
                <h2>Treatment</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>
              <p>Most cases of acute torticollis resolve on their own within 1-2 weeks. A systematic Cochrane review
                from 2025 (Chacko et al.) shows that manual therapy combined with exercises can provide better function
                and some pain relief compared to no treatment - with an actual benefit of about 14% for function and 24%
                for pain.</p>

              <p>In clinical practice, the chiropractor often uses a combination of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Gentle mobilization</strong> - movement in pain-free directions to regain mobility</li>
                <li><strong>Soft tissue treatment</strong> - massage and <a href="neck-trigger-points.html">trigger
                    point</a> treatment to loosen tight muscles</li>
                <li><strong>Manipulation</strong> - if indicated, joint adjustment can be helpful</li>
                <li><strong>Exercises and advice</strong> - home exercises and ergonomic tips to prevent recurrence</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Treatment starts in pain-free directions of movement - this is safer and more comfortable than pushing
                against the pain (Clinical Edge, 2024).</p>

              <h3>What can you do yourself?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep moving</strong> - move your neck gently as far as possible without too much pain. Avoid
                  keeping your neck completely still.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat or cold</strong> - ice for the first 48-72 hours can reduce acute inflammation, then
                  heat may feel soothing. Use 15-20 minutes at a time.</li>
                <li><strong>Pain relievers</strong> - paracetamol at recommended dose is often sufficient. Ibuprofen can
                  be used if needed in the acute phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid neck collar</strong> - immobilization weakens muscles and delays healing (Joint
                  Academy).</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Treatment Course</h3>
              <p>For typical acute facet joint torticollis, many can experience significant improvement after 1-3
                treatments over a few days to a week (MSK Doctors). With discogenic cause, healing takes longer - often
                4-8 weeks (Cetilar).</p>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Honest expectation</h3>
                <p>A control study showed that 79% of patients who didn't receive treatment also reported improvement
                  after one year (Pain Medicine, 2021). Treatment can speed up improvement, but most people get better
                  regardless.</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Fever combined with sore throat and headache</li>

                <h2>Prognosis</h2>
              </div>
              <p>The prognosis for acute torticollis is very good. Most people recover completely within 1-2 weeks,
                regardless of treatment (Medscape, 2024). The most common form (facet joint torticollis) can often
                resolve within 24-48 hours.</p>
              <p>Recurrence is common - approximately 50% experience a new episode at some point (Range Physiotherapy -
                clinical estimate). Therefore, it's wise to work on prevention: good ergonomics, suitable pillow,
                regular movement, and strengthening exercises for neck and shoulders.</p>
              <p>A small minority may develop persistent problems over months. In such cases, thorough investigation is
                important to rule out other causes.</p>

              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How long does wry neck last?</h3>
                <p>Most people experience significant improvement within 2-7 days, and full recovery within 1-2 weeks.
                  With discogenic cause, it may take 4-8 weeks.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Should I keep my neck still?</h3>
                <p>No. Gentle movement is better than stillness. Keeping the neck completely still weakens muscles and
                  can prolong healing. Move within your pain tolerance.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Is acute torticollis dangerous?</h3>
                <p>In the vast majority of cases, it is completely harmless. Rare cases with fever, neurological
                  symptoms, or trauma should be examined by a doctor to rule out more serious conditions.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Do I need X-ray or MRI?</h3>
                <p>Usually not. The diagnosis is made clinically. Imaging is only appropriate for red flags, persistent
                  symptoms beyond 2 weeks, or neurological deficits.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Does a chiropractor help with wry neck?</h3>
                <p>The Cochrane review from 2025 shows moderate evidence that manual therapy combined with exercises can
                  provide somewhat faster improvement in function and pain. Most people recover regardless, but
                  treatment can speed up the process.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I prevent recurrence?</h3>
                <p>Yes, partially. Good sleeping position with the right pillow, regular movement, ergonomic workplace,
                  and strengthening exercises for neck/shoulders can reduce the risk of new episodes.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>When should I seek help?</h3>
                <p>You don't need to wait to seek help - a chiropractor can evaluate you promptly. Early treatment can
                  provide faster pain relief. For red flags (fever, neurological symptoms, trauma), you should see a
                  doctor the same day.</p>
