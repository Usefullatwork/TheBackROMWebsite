                <h2>What is post-traumatic headache after whiplash?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Post-traumatic headache (PTH) is headache that develops after an injury to the head or neck. In <a
                  href="whiplash.html">whiplash</a>, this typically occurs after an acceleration-deceleration mechanism
                - such as rear-end collision, falls, or sports injuries.</p>
              <p>Between 30-90% of all who experience whiplash develop headache in the acute phase (Al-Khazali et al.,
                2020). A meta-analysis from 2023 showed that 47% still have headache one year after the injury (Herrero
                Babiloni et al., Pain 2023).</p>
              <p>In Northern Sweden, approximately 235 whiplash injuries per 100,000 inhabitants are reported annually
                (Styrke et al., Spine 2012).</p>
              <p>The International Headache Classification (ICHD-3, 2018) distinguishes between:</p>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Acute PTH</h3>
                <p>Headache that starts within 7 days of injury and lasts less than 3 months.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Persistent (chronic) PTH</h3>
                <p>Headache that continues beyond 3 months after the injury.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Quebec Task Force classifies whiplash (WAD) into grades from 0-IV, where grades I-II make up
                approximately 90% of all cases. Grade II - with neck pain and reduced mobility - has the highest risk of
                developing chronic symptoms.</p>

                <h2>Why do you get headache after whiplash?</h2>
              </div>
              <h3>Most common causes - from most to least common</h3>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>1. Facet joint injuries (approx. 60% of chronic cases)</h3>
                <p>Studies with diagnostic blocks show that the facet joints in the neck are the main source of pain in
                  the majority with chronic whiplash (Lord & Barnsley, Spine 1996). The most frequently affected levels
                  are C2-C3 (36%) and C5-C6 (35%).</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>2. Muscle and ligament injuries</h3>
                <p>The deep neck muscles and ligaments - especially around the upper cervical joints (C1-C2) - often
                  sustain microtrauma. MRI studies have shown fatty infiltration in these muscles after whiplash.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>3. Trigeminocervical convergence</h3>
                <p>Pain nerves from the neck (C1-C3) meet the trigeminal nerve in the brainstem. This explains why neck
                  injury causes headache - pain signals from the neck are "misinterpreted" as headache.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>4. Central sensitization</h3>
                <p>In chronic whiplash, the nervous system can become hypersensitive. Systematic reviews confirm that
                  chronic WAD involves central sensitization with lower pain thresholds and enhanced pain perception
                  (Van Oosterwijck et al., 2013).</p>

                <p>Pulsating pain, often unilateral, with nausea, light and sound sensitivity. Many experience this for
                  the first time after the injury.</p>

                <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
              </div>
              <h3>Clinical examination is most important</h3>
              <p>For whiplash, we always start with a thorough clinical examination. We examine neck mobility, joint
                function, muscles and neurological status. The Canadian C-Spine Rule is used to assess whether imaging
                is necessary.</p>
              <h3>When is imaging needed?</h3>
              <p>X-ray or CT is only necessary when fracture or dislocation is suspected. Indications include: age over
                65, dangerous injury mechanism, tingling/numbness in arms or legs, or inability to actively move the
                neck.</p>
              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>MRI - often misunderstood</h3>
                <p>MRI in whiplash often shows normal findings or age-related wear that doesn't explain the pain.
                  Studies show that MRI findings in people with whiplash often don't differ from healthy individuals.
                  Clinical examination usually provides better information than imaging.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <section class="hub-section" id="s5">
              <div class="section-header">
                <span class="section-number">5</span>
                <h2>Treatment</h2>
              </div>
              <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>
              <p>A Cochrane review from 2007 reviewed 23 studies with over 2,300 participants. The main conclusion was
                clear: Early active mobilization is clearly better than rest and neck collar.</p>
              <div class="treatment-box">
                <h3>We use gentle techniques adapted to the injury phase:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Mobilization:</strong> Soft techniques to restore movement in locked joints. In acute
                    whiplash, we avoid forceful manipulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Soft tissue treatment:</strong> Treatment of tight muscles that try to "protect" the neck.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Vestibular rehabilitation:</strong> Many become dizzy after whiplash. We provide exercises
                    to train balance and coordination between eyes, ears and neck.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <p>A meta-analysis from 2022 (Bini et al., Chiropractic & Manual Therapies) showed moderate to large
                short-term effects on headache intensity in cervicogenic headache treated with manual therapy.</p>

              <h3>What can you do yourself?</h3>
              <p>Norwegian health authorities recommend that exercise should start within 4 days after the injury. Neck
                collar is unnecessary in most cases and can actually prolong symptoms if used for more than 48 hours.
              </p>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Early movement</h3>
                <p>Repeated, gentle neck and head movements provide more relief than rest.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Deep neck muscles</h3>
                <p>Exercises for the deep neck flexors are important. These muscles often "shut off" after whiplash, and
                  the larger superficial muscles take over - which can cause more headache.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Avoid inactivity</h3>
                <p>Those who rest and use collar have twice the risk of persistent symptoms as those who move early
                  (McKinney et al., 1989).</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Treatment course</h3>
              <p>There are no clear guidelines for exact number of treatments for whiplash. A systematic review
                (American Journal of PM&R, 2024) found best results with at least 2 sessions per week for minimum 6
                weeks.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute phase (0-6 weeks):</strong> Focus on pain relief, restoring movement and reassurance
                </li>
                <li><strong>Subacute phase (6-12 weeks):</strong> Gradual increase in activity and stabilizing exercises
                </li>
                <li><strong>Chronic phase (>12 weeks):</strong> Multimodal approach with focus on psychosocial factors
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Most with uncomplicated whiplash improve significantly within 3 months. But some need longer follow-up,
                especially with grade II-III.</p>

              <p>Research shows that improvement mainly occurs during the first 3 months after the injury. After this,
                the improvement curve flattens dramatically. A study found that 86% of those who were still symptomatic
                at 3 months remained symptomatic after 2 years.</p>
              <h3>Three typical courses (Sterling et al., JOSPT 2016)</h3>
              <div class="stat-grid">
                <div class="stat-item">
                  <span class="stat-number">~50%</span>
                  <span class="stat-label">Mild course: Full recovery</span>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-item">
                  <span class="stat-number">~30%</span>
                  <span class="stat-label">Moderate course: Persistent moderate symptoms</span>
                </div>
                <div class="stat-item">
                  <span class="stat-number">~20%</span>
                  <span class="stat-label">Severe course: Chronic disability</span>
                </div>
              </div>

              <h3>Risk factors for poor outcome</h3>
              <p>High initial pain intensity, high functional disability from the start, cold sensitivity, pain
                catastrophizing and post-traumatic stress symptoms increase the risk of chronicity. Low expectations of
                improvement is a strong negative prognostic factor.</p>

              <h3>Relapse is common</h3>
              <p>Even among those who recover, many experience relapse. Long-term studies show that only about 35% are
                fully recovered after 5 years. This underscores the importance of learning self-management strategies.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>How long does headache after whiplash last?</h3>
              <p>In most people (50-80%), the headache resolves within 3 months. Around 20-50% develop chronic symptoms
                that last longer. Early active treatment reduces the risk of chronicity.</p>

              <h3>Should I use a neck collar?</h3>
              <p>No, in most cases. Norwegian health authorities recommend that collar not be used, or maximum 48 hours
                for grade II-III. Research shows that collar can prolong symptoms.</p>

              <h3>Can a chiropractor help with headache after whiplash?</h3>
              <p>Yes, manual treatment has moderate evidence for improving headache and neck pain in the short term,
                especially combined with exercises. Early treatment gives better results than waiting.</p>

              <h3>When should I get an MRI of my neck?</h3>
              <p>MRI is rarely necessary for uncomplicated whiplash. Imaging is only indicated with neurological
                deficits or suspicion of serious injury. Clinical examination is often more informative.</p>

              <h3>Can I exercise after whiplash?</h3>
              <p>Yes, and you should start early. Norwegian health authorities recommend starting within 4 days. Begin
                with gentle movements and increase gradually. Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting in the acute phase.
              </p>

              <h3>What's the difference between migraine and headache from the neck?</h3>
              <p><a href="cervicogenic-headache.html">Cervicogenic headache</a> starts in the neck and worsens with neck
                strain. Migraine is often pulsating, unilateral and accompanied by nausea/light sensitivity. In
                post-traumatic headache, we often see a mix. Read more about <a
                  href="occipital-neuralgia.html">occipital neuralgia</a> for information about other types of headache
                that can occur after neck injury.</p>

              <h3>How many treatments do I need?</h3>
              <p>This varies. Acute cases can improve after 4-6 treatments. Chronic symptoms may require longer
                follow-up. We evaluate continuously and adapt treatment.</p>
