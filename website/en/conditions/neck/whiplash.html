                <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Whiplash-associated disorders (WAD) are symptoms after

                <h2>What is whiplash?</h2>
              </div>
              <p>Whiplash describes an injury mechanism where the head is suddenly thrown forward and backward. The term
                "whiplash-associated disorders" (WAD) is used for symptoms that occur after such an injury. It is
                therefore not a diagnosis in itself, but a description of how the injury occurred.</p>
              <p>Rear-end collision in a car is the most common cause, but whiplash can also occur during sports
                accidents, falls, or other situations with rapid movement of the neck. <strong>83% of people involved in
                  car accidents experience some degree of whiplash injury</strong> (PMC, 2009).</p>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Cervical sprain, cervical strain and whiplash - the same condition</h3>
                <p>The terms "cervical sprain" and "cervical strain" are often used interchangeably. The Quebec Task
                  Force acknowledged as early as 1995 that these conditions cannot be distinguished through clinical
                  examination or standard imaging. Theoretically, "sprain" refers to ligament damage, while "strain"
                  describes muscle-tendon injury. In practice, this distinction has no significance for treatment.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Prevalence</h3>
              <p>Norway has the world's highest prevalence of neck pain, with 6,151 cases per 100,000 inhabitants
                according to the Global Burden of Disease study. In the Nordic countries, approximately 235-383 people
                per 100,000 are affected by whiplash annually. Women have approximately twice the risk of men for
                developing symptoms after rear-end collision.</p>

              </div>
              <h3>Most common causes</h3>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Car accidents (whiplash)</h3>
                <p>The classic cause. During rear-end collision, the neck is exposed to rapid acceleration-deceleration
                  that can damage soft tissues.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Sports injuries</h3>
                <p>Contact sports such as football, rugby, and martial arts increase risk through direct impacts or
                  falls.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="condition-card">
                <h3>Falls and accidents</h3>
                <p>Falls from height or sudden movements can cause soft tissue injuries.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>Risk factors for prolonged symptoms</h3>
              <p>Research has identified several factors that increase the risk of chronic symptoms (Walton et al.,
                2013):</p>
              <ul>
                <li>High pain intensity from the start (above 5.5/10)</li>
                <li>High functional disability from the start</li>
                <li>Catastrophizing (excessive worry about symptoms)</li>
                <li>Fear of movement</li>
                <li>Previous neck problems</li>
                <li>Post-traumatic stress symptoms</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Interesting finding</h3>
                <p>Research shows that the collision itself (direction, speed, headrest type) does not significantly
                  affect prognosis. Imaging findings also do not predict prognosis - psychosocial factors matter far
                  more.</p>

              </div>
              <h3>Main symptoms</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Neck pain and stiffness</strong> - 62-100% (the most common symptom)</li>
                <li><strong>Headache</strong> - 60-88%, often originating from the neck</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder and upper back stiffness</strong> - approx. 72%</li>
                <li><strong>Fatigue</strong> - 70-80%</li>
                <li><strong>Dizziness</strong> - 25-50% (up to 85% in some studies)</li>
                <li><strong>Concentration difficulties</strong> - approx. 41%</li>
              </ul>

              <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Delayed symptom onset is common</h3>
                <p>Symptoms don't need to appear immediately. Many experience delayed onset from 12 hours to several
                  days after the accident. This delay of 12-72 hours is characteristic and is due in part to adrenaline
                  and endorphins masking pain in the acute phase.</p>

                <h2>Treatment</h2>
              </div>
              <h3>What can the chiropractor do?</h3>
              <p>Systematic reviews show that multimodal treatment - the combination of manual therapy and exercises -
                gives better results than single interventions alone (Hidalgo et al., 2017).</p>

              <div class="treatment-box">
                <h3>Treatment may include:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Manual treatment:</strong> Gentle mobilization of neck joints and muscles</li>
                  <li><strong>Soft tissue treatment:</strong> <a href="neck-trigger-points.html">Trigger point</a>
                    therapy, muscle stretching and fascial treatment</li>
                  <li><strong>Active rehabilitation:</strong> Specific exercises for strength, stability and mobility
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Advice and guidance:</strong> Information about the condition and what you can do yourself
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h3>Early mobilization - not rest</h3>
              <p>One of the most important findings from whiplash research is that <strong>early activity gives better
                  results than rest and neck collar</strong>. A study by McKinney (1989) showed that 46% of those who
                were told to rest with a neck collar still had symptoms after two years, compared to only 23% of those
                who received advice about early mobilization.</p>

              <div class="prognosis-box">
                <h3>Neck collar is not recommended</h3>
                <p>Neck collar and prolonged rest are not recommended in modern guidelines. International guidelines
                  give Grade A recommendation against the use of neck collar.</p>
              </div>

              <h3>What can you do yourself?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay active:</strong> Avoid prolonged rest and bed rest - gradual return to normal
                  activities promotes healing</li>
                <li><strong>Move neck gently:</strong> Calm movements in all directions several times daily, within
                  comfort zone</li>

              <h3>Treatment course</h3>
              <p>For acute whiplash (WAD I-II), the OPTIMa guidelines recommend:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute phase:</strong> 2-3 treatments per week for 2-4 weeks (6-12 treatments total)</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessment of response after 6-12 treatments</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent symptoms:</strong> 1-2 treatments per week with gradual tapering, increasing
                  focus on self-training</li>
              </ul>

                <h3>The first three months are crucial</h3>
                <p>An important finding is that the first three months are decisive for long-term prognosis. A study
                  showed that 93% of those who were symptom-free at three months remained symptom-free after two years.
                  Conversely, 86% of those with symptoms at three months still had symptoms after two years.</p>

              <h3>Preventing relapse</h3>
              <p><strong>Exercise reduces the risk of new episodes by 53%</strong> (RR 0.47) according to a
                meta-analysis from 2023 (Campos, JOSPT, 2023). This is the most important preventive factor. Regular
                exercise - especially neck and shoulder stabilizing exercises - is highly recommended.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
              </div>

              <h3>How long does whiplash take to heal?</h3>
              <p>Most people experience significant improvement within 2-3 months. About half recover fully, while
                approximately 50% have some persistent symptoms after one year.</p>

              <h3>Should I use a neck collar?</h3>
              <p>No, neck collar is not recommended for normal whiplash (Grade A evidence against). Research shows that
                early movement and activity give better results than immobilization.</p>

              <h3>What's the difference between cervical sprain, strain and whiplash?</h3>
              <p>In practice, none. Theoretically, "sprain" involves ligaments and "strain" muscles/tendons, but they
                cannot be distinguished through examination or imaging. The Quebec Task Force acknowledged this as early
                as 1995. Treatment is identical.</p>

              <h3>Can symptoms appear several days after the accident?</h3>
              <p>Yes, this is common. Symptoms can appear from 12 hours to several days (typically 12-72 hours) after
                the injury.</p>

              <h3>How can I prevent new episodes?</h3>
              <p>Regular exercise - especially neck and shoulder stabilizing exercises - reduces the risk of relapse by
                over 50%.</p>
