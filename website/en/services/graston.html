              <p>The Graston technique, also known as IASTM (Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization), uses special

              <h2>What is Graston/IASTM?</h2>
            </div>
            <p>IASTM stands for "Instrument-Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization"  -  treatment of soft tissue with
              instruments. Graston is the most recognized and documented brand name.</p>
            <p>The treatment is based on traditional Chinese Gua Sha, but uses modern, ergonomic instruments made of
              medical grade steel. The tools have different shapes and edges that make it possible to reach different
              body areas  -  from large muscle groups in the back to small structures in hands and feet.</p>

            <p>Let me be honest about what we know  -  and don't know  -  about this treatment form.</p>

            <div class="evidence-box">
              <h3>The Latest Research (2026)</h3>
              <div class="evidence-item">
                <strong>Moderate Effect on Pain</strong>
                A recent systematic review in BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders (March 2026) shows that IASTM can reduce
                pain  -  with moderate certainty in the conclusion.
              </div>
              <div class="evidence-item">
                <strong>Improved Function</strong>
                The same study shows that IASTM can improve function  -  but with low certainty in the conclusion.
              </div>
              <div class="evidence-item">
                <strong>Chronic Neck Pain</strong>
                For chronic neck pain and headache from the neck, research shows clear short-term effect on pain.
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
              <h3>What Does This Mean in Practice?</h3>
              <p>Graston/IASTM appears to give better results than no treatment, especially short-term for pain. But
                research is also clear that <strong>best effect is achieved when instrument treatment is combined with
                  active measures</strong> like stretching, strength exercises and movement.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #64748b; font-style: italic;">This matches my own experience. I never
                use Graston in isolation, but as part of a comprehensive approach where I also work to strengthen and
                activate the area.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0; color: #64748b;">I evaluate progress along the way and adjust the plan

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Is Graston painful?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Treatment shouldn't hurt. You'll feel pressure and sometimes discomfort over
                tender areas, but I adjust the intensity. Always let me know if it becomes too much.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">How many treatments will I need?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">This varies. Acute problems may improve with 3-4 treatments. Chronic conditions
                often need 6-8 treatments or more. I assess your response along the way and give you realistic
                expectations.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Can I exercise afterward?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Yes, most can exercise normally. Some prefer to wait until the next day if the
                area is sore. Light activity the same day is often beneficial.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between Graston and regular massage?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">Graston provides more precise treatment of specific structures. The instruments
                help me feel and treat scar tissue, tight bands and adhesions. Massage has broader application for
                general relaxation.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <div class="faq-question">Do bruises mean something is wrong?</div>
              <div class="faq-answer">No. Mild bruises are a normal reaction and mean the treatment has affected the
                tissue. They usually disappear within 48-72 hours and often become less noticeable with subsequent
                treatments.</div>
