## Patterns Found (All Compliant)

### Comparative Language (85 instances)
All comparative statements ("bedre enn" / "better than") are:
- Based on cited clinical studies
- Comparing treatment modalities (e.g., exercise vs. cortisone)
- Not making superiority claims about the clinic itself

**Example of compliant language:**
> "LEAP-studien viste at trening + opplæring ga 78.6% suksessrate etter ett år – bedre enn kortison (58%) og «vent og se» (52%)"

This is factual, cited, and appropriately hedged.

### "Beste" (Best) Usage (12 instances)
Used in appropriate contexts:
- "beste behandling" in FAQ questions (user-facing)
- "beste pute" for patient guidance
- Always followed by evidence-based recommendations

## Specific Items for Review (Optional Improvements)

While the site is compliant, these items could be strengthened:

| File | Text | Severity | Recommendation |
|------|------|----------|----------------|
| `en/conditions/headache.html` | "responds best to chiropractic treatment" | MEDIUM | Add citation or hedge with "often" |
| `en/services/graston.html` | "best effect is achieved when..." | MEDIUM | Change to "optimal effect may be achieved" |
| `plager/albue-arm.html` | "fungerer bedre enn fullstendig hvile" | MEDIUM | Add inline citation |

**Note:** These are minor improvements, not violations. The current text is defensible with the research cited elsewhere on the pages.

## Recommendations

### Maintain Current Standards
1. Continue citing specific studies for treatment claims
2. Keep using percentage-based outcomes rather than absolutes
3. Maintain hedging language ("kan", "ofte", "de fleste")

### Minor Suggestions (Optional)
1. Consider adding source links to key statistics
2. Add publication years to some citations for transparency
3. Consider adding "individual results may vary" disclaimers to treatment pages
4. For "best" claims, add "research suggests" or similar hedging

- **Forsvarlig** (responsible): Claims backed by research
