## Codebase Patterns
- Norwegian HTML files use UTF-8 encoding
- Some files were originally in Windows-1252 (cp1252) encoding and needed conversion
- The /en/ folder contains English pages and should never be modified when fixing Norwegian text
- Common encoding corruption pattern: æ, ø, å appear as Unicode replacement character (U+FFFD)

---

## 2026-01-23 - ENC-001 through ENC-010 (Encoding Fixes)
- **What was implemented:** Fixed all encoding errors (corrupted æ, ø, å characters) across Norwegian pages
- **Files changed:** 144 files in /plager/ directory, 4 files needed Windows-1252 to UTF-8 conversion
- **Total replacements:** 25,005 character corrections
- **Method:** Created fix-encoding.py script with comprehensive replacement dictionary
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered: Most encoding issues were in /plager/ subfolders
  - Gotchas encountered: Some files (vestibulaer-migrene.html, 3 tjeneste files) were in Windows-1252 encoding, not broken UTF-8
  - Useful context: grep -r "replacement-char" --include="*.html" . | grep -v "/en/" is good for finding issues

## 2026-01-23 - GRAM-001 through GRAM-003 (og/å Grammar)
- **What was implemented:** Searched for og/å grammar errors
- **Files changed:** None - no errors found
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered: The content appears to have been written with correct Norwegian grammar
  - Gotchas encountered: Many "og + verb" patterns are actually correct (e.g., "og få innsikt" can be valid)
  - Useful context: Look for specific error patterns like "for og", "prøve og", "begynne og"

## 2026-01-23 - SPELL-001 (Spelling Corrections)
- **What was implemented:** Fixed spelling errors across all Norwegian pages
- **Files changed:** 46 files
- **Total corrections:** 89+
- **Specific fixes:**
  - Dærlig → Dårlig
  - Sårlig → Særlig
  - fårer → fører
  - nåytral → nøytral
  - Svåmming → Svømming
  - Vestibulår → Vestibulær
  - Muskulår → Muskulær
  - Leidd → Ledd
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Pattern discovered: Common confusion between -ær and -år word endings
  - Gotchas encountered: "først" and "første" are correct spellings (not errors)
  - Useful context: Medical/technical terms often have -ær endings (vestibulær, muskulær)

---

## 2026-01-23 - VERIFY-001 (Final Verification)
- **What was verified:**
  - No encoding errors (replacement characters) remaining
  - No known spelling errors remaining
  - All files properly UTF-8 encoded
- **Result:** All checks passed

---

## Summary
- **Total files modified:** ~190
- **Total character replacements:** 25,000+
- **Total spelling corrections:** 89+
- **Status:** COMPLETE
